# :fish: Doug-E-Fish


<p id='pageTitle'>Welcome!</p>
This is a web app created for people who like to fish in the Greater Hampton Roads Area.
My hope is that it is used and enjoyed by everyone who loves all things fishing! <i>Enjoy!</i>
<br></br>

It is serverless app with full CRUD operations. 
Airtable's documentation is weak, but the cloud db allows my dad (a non-coder) to easily 
maintain the website. If functionality increases, the next version will be to swap out
Airtable with an actual database. We've already maxed out Airtable functionality without spending
copious amounts of time studying their software. CRMs (in my opinion) are becoming more
trouble than they are worth. The rapid changes in technology require that more people know
how to code. CRMs cripple this avenue. Learn coding! It's fun and empowering!
