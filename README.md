# :fish: Doug-E-Fish


<p id='pageTitle'>Welcome!</p>
This is a web app created for people who like to fish in the Greater Hampton Roads Area.
My hope is that it is used and enjoyed by everyone who loves all things fishing! <i>Enjoy!</i>


#### Design and Architecture
Doug-E-Fish is a serverless app with full CRUD operations. 
Airtable's documentation is weak, but the cloud db allows my dad (a non-coder) to easily 
maintain the website. If functionality increases, the next app version will be to swap out
Airtable with an actual database. We've already maxed out Airtable functionality without spending
copious amounts of time studying their software. Workflow Management Software and CRMs (in my opinion) are becoming more
trouble than they are worth, because of their large learning curve. Also, the reliance on 3rd party software can be somewhat risky and
in the long run more costly. Rapid changes in technology require that more people know how to code (seems obvious). Intermediary software 
solutions (though well intended) cripple this avenue. Learn coding! It's fun and empowering!
