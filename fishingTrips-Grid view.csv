225,5/27/2023,Hilton Fishing Pier,"It was a cooler than usual day for late May. Windy, but sunny! We caught quite a few croaker and one flounder (see photo album!) Can't wait to get back out here!",5,https://photos.app.goo.gl/TmFzfUUudr87wo9F6,8,high tide
226,6/18/2023,James River Fishing Pier,Mainly crabs were pulling. Dad caught one small one. No one around us was really catching anything. We did see dolphins! Kept our wrist bands in case we wanted to come back later. We did see a few people put lines and when they didn't any hits leave. We assume they were going to come back for the night high tide? Check out this cool sign using a dolphin for covid spacing! lol,3,https://photos.app.goo.gl/kNdbRDwuiV6qobs26,1,high tide
227,9/2/2023,Harwood's Mill Fishing Area,This was our first time at Hardwood Mill! We didn't get very far since we rented a John Boat and had to paddle with some ancient oars into the lake. The oars had splinters and were made for viking-type people. We though next time it would be best to bring a motor. I caught some seaweed (see pic). Despite our luck we had fun! It was our first go and learned quite a bit. We'll be better prepared for next time. Can't wait to see what the lake looks like with all the colored foliage in the fall!  ,2,https://photos.app.goo.gl/BZpyoBbyriRJvRNPA,0,na
228,7/30/2023,Hilton Fishing Pier,Caught a bunch of little baby croaker! They were SMALL! A school of fish were jumping around the pier and towards the end of our adventure (as our worms began to run low) I caught the moby dick! A rainbow trout! We were sure this was one of jumper fish in our watery midst. I had never caught one of these before. It wasn't spiny but instead seemed to be something I'd consider eating. None of the fish we've caught this season we've kept. I threw this one back to meet the sweet fated freedom we gave the rest. We will never forget you moby dick! Hilton Pier for the win.... once again!,5,https://photos.app.goo.gl/EMqA3g9hpF37fQpYA,7,high tide
